      <h1>How to play</h1>

      <p>The keys to move are W, A, S, and D. W is the up for the mover, s is down,
      a is left and d is right.</p>

      <p>Arrow keys do not work, the WASD pair of keys after all is more user friendly
      and simple to understand.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>

      <p>The number one rule of the Maze Game Deluxe is simple do not hit the green walls.</p>

      <p>You are also not allowed to exit the maze unless you reach the yellow finish square.</p>

      <h2>Reward</h2>

      <p>If you complete all levels then you are a great person!</p>
